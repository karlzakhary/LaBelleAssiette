### Subject

Chef Amit is confronted to a big problem: due to his incredible number of bookings, maintaining a count of everything he has in his huge kitchen became a pain.
He would like a web application to help him manage an inventory of all the ingredients he posseses.

Build a small application to help chef Amit manage his stock.
He wants to be able to:
- add ingredients to his inventory
- deal with quantities
- change the name of his ingredients in case he mispelled it
- remove the ingredients he has already used for cooking

He likes his applications to be intuitive :)

### Constraints

You need to follow the `package.json` directives and make you own `app.js` file.

The data composition and the file(s) format are totally up to you.

You can use whatever you want for the GUI (but it must be javascript-based and in the browser).

You will find a <a href="https://github.com/LaBelleAssiette/jobs/blob/master/part1/ingredients.json">list of ingredients</a> to help you in the same folder

### Bonus

By reading the ingredients list you will notice that some ingredients are linked to a boolean instead of a quantity, try to make it relevant in your application!
