						This application helps track and manage inventory by allowing users to add and subtract quantities for
						different parts.  Each part has the following attributes:
						<ul>
							<li>Part number - The unique part identifer in the inventory</li>
							<li>Description - A simple description of the part</li>
							<li>Cost - The euro cost per part</li>
							<li>Quantity - The number of parts currently held within inventory</li>
							<li>UOM - Unit of Measurement used to measure the part</li>
							<!-- <li>Children - Any parts that are used to create this part "Recipe of that part"</li> -->
						</ul>
						
						Parts can be added to the inventory at will and quantities can be removed or added as they are moved
						in and out of physical space.
